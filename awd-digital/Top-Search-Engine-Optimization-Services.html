										<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today's competitive world, businesses are constantly trying to stand out from the competition, and one of the easiest ways to do so is through the use of SEO. SEO, or search engine optimization, is a key element of a website's success, as it allows a business to rank high in search results, allowing it to be found by potential customers online.</span></p>
<h2>Top Search Engine Optimization Services</h2>

An SEO provider should take an in-depth look at where a customer currently stands with regards to current traffic and sales and analyze where the business excels and where it needs improvement. The audit will look at website features that are traditionally used to determine a website&rsquo;s SERP ranking including broken links, title tags, and image alt text.</span></p>
