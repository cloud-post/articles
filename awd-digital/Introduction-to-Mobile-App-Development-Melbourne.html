                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As technology continuously changes and evolves, so do the mobile applications and their functionalities. However, a major challenge in today's world is that mobile applications are not being developed in a way that allows them to be </span><strong>easily reused</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is mainly due to the various programming languages used, their different environments, and the various frameworks that are available.&nbsp;</span></p><br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This can lead to the undesirable scenario of having to build a new application from scratch every time an update is needed. If this is the case, it is necessary to understand the basics of mobile </span><a href="http://awddigital.com.au/app-developers/mobile-applications/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">app development Melbourne</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and how it can be applied to increase efficiency.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose a Platform</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next time you make a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app#:~:text=A%20mobile%20application%2C%20also%20referred,phone%2C%20tablet%2C%20or%20watch."><span style="font-weight: 400;">mobile app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">choose one platform to build it on</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is one of the most common ideas that we hear when people are first starting a mobile app project. But what is the best choice for building apps? There are many prominent choices, and this is a great place to start learning about them.</span></p>

<div class="grid_12"><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop for both Android and iOS: Native apps or hybrid apps?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been a lot of talk recently about the benefits and perils of developing native apps versus hybrid apps, but before diving into the deep end, it's important to understand what each of these terms mean. With native apps, the code you write is compiled into a </span><strong>native app format</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that runs directly on a hardware platform like Android, iOS, and Windows.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The experience of </span><a href="https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/native-web-or-hybrid-apps"><span style="font-weight: 400;">using native apps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is usually faster and more responsive because the app has complete access to the hardware and system-level APIs. Hybrid apps, on the other hand, are written in code that runs directly on the mobile device but is compiled into a mobile app format that runs on multiple hardware platforms like iOS and Android. Hybrid apps have access to the device's hardware and system-level.</span></p><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Native applications</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Native applications are applications built for specific operating systems, such as iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and Blackberry. They are developed using a pre-built SDK, which comes along with the operating system. Just as with native web applications, these applications are stable and future-proof, and they run on any mobile operating system without the need for web technology, a browser, or third party software.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progressive web apps</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term &ldquo;</span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps"><span style="font-weight: 400;">progressive web apps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo; is confusing, but what they are boils down to is a new way of building and delivering apps that will work even on older devices with limited functionality and a slow connection. Progressive web apps </span><strong>use web technologies</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to offer a consistent user experience across all devices and platforms, even if the platform itself is less capable. They support features like offline access, push notifications, and access to native device APIs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encapsulated Apps is an </span><a href="https://www.g2.com/categories/mobile-development-platforms"><span style="font-weight: 400;">app development platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, backed by a community of developers, entrepreneurs and startups.&nbsp; It is designed to make it easy for developers to build and publish mobile apps that are both beautiful and robust.&nbsp; Encapsulated Apps has several features, including a design platform, an app template library, continuous development, and other mobile app tools.</span></p><br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The App Template Library is a </span><strong>component SDK</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for building iOS apps.&nbsp; The SDK is a UIKit, CoreGraphics, and QuartzCore based framework that is easy to use and can be configured to build apps with a minimum of code.&nbsp; The App Template Library is a free component of Encapsulated Apps that allows developers to create their own app designs.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">App Marketplaces</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">App marketplaces are becoming an increasingly popular place to find new apps to install on your smartphone or tablet. However, they can also be an opportunity for malware and virus distributors to make a quick buck. In this post, we'll explain how to stay safe in the app marketplaces and what to look for when evaluating a potential app for download.</span></p><br>
