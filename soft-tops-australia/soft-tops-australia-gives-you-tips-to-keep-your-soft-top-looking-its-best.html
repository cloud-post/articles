After all, the top is the first thing people see when they look at your car. If it's looking worn, faded, or shabby, then it's bound to detract from your car's overall appearance. Luckily, with proper care and maintenance, a convertible top can <strong>add years</strong> to a vehicle's aesthetic appeal.</p>

Go through the tips below from Prestige <a href="https://www.prestigetops.com.au/">Soft Tops Australia</a> to keep your car's paint job looking its best weeks after summer ends.</p>
<h2>Cleaning &amp; Maintenance Tips:</h2>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">Clean minor damage as quickly as possible, especially leaks, rips, and damages. Most <em>fixable issues can become a major problem</em> very quickly.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Ratifiers of convertible top steam-cleaning guidance recommend against using citrus, bleach, silicone, or petroleum-based products in cleaning the <strong>convertible top</strong>. Serving as intermediary cleaning agents, these products make convertible tops less impervious to water, thus promoting potential damage to seals and seams. In rarer instances, proprietors might even be at risk for a factory warranty void.</li>
<li aria-level="1">A mild, natural, non-detergent-based auto shampoo without an alcohol content in the product is best suited for convertible top cleaning. Use a product like this for tops only.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Make sure to thoroughly rinse after cleaning, any residue left by cleaners may leave the color!</li>
<li aria-level="1">Ensure that the convertible is either taken in an automatic car wash or isn't driven.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Plastic windows and doors made of plastic do not benefit from <em>paper towels or windex</em>. The best cleaning choice is a gentle microfiber towel and water. Window cleaning solutions can harm the window and might result in deteriorating it and eventually creating light spots.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Quickly cleaning fabric convertible tops in the vicinity of heavily soiled locations, <em>use a soft bristled brush</em>. Slowly rub the garment and tap lightly after cleaning.</li>
<li aria-level="1">It's important to keep a vinyl convertible top by using a <strong>soft microfiber cloth</strong> only, never use a brush or paper towel on it.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Like with other skin care products, it is generally not necessary to use additional spray for extra coating if proper cleaning and care are provided.</li>

<h2>General Usage &amp; Problem Areas:</h2>
<ol>

<li aria-level="1">Never slide the top all the way down when temperatures are below 60 degrees.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Keep in mind that it is dangerous to leave a convertible top down overnight.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Never park a convertible with the top up for extended periods of time.</li>
<li aria-level="1">When laying your convertible top down, make sure that the deck have already cleared of any and all objects. Materials left behind could scratch or puncture a plastic window and may possibly crack a glass window. With enough pressure, frame material can also be damaged by these objects.</li>

<li aria-level="1">If you are thinking about convertible top replacement, refrain from "helping" your upholsterer by trying to remove the top yourself. There is a process for removing and reinstalling the convertible top that should be done to a professional's specifications.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Should the top or convertible top motor require repair, refrain from forcing it, and rely on a professional. If you do not need a <strong>skilled convertible top specialist</strong> to fix frame or motor problems, navigate to a repair shop.</li>
<li aria-level="1">When liquid does trickle down your convertible top's backside, both the waterproofing and the UV protection have worn away and it is time for you to have your top repaired by a convertible top repair shop.</li>
