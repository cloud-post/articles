<ol>
<li> Advantages: <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/desktop-application">Desktop applications</a> are simpler to work with than web applications. They are also practical when accessed from a computer with a web connection.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li> Disadvantages: One downside of web applications is that they can be less reliable than desktop applications. They are also <strong>more vulnerable to security threats</strong>, since they are often hosted on remote servers.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li> Advantages: Developing and maintaining web applications are considerably <strong>more affordable than desktop programs</strong>, and they feature a wide range of features that are impossible with desktop applications.</li>
</ol>

<li> Disadvantages: One downside of web applications is that they can be <strong>less intuitive and user-friendly</strong> than desktop applications.</li>

<h2>What is a Web Application ?</h2>
<p>A web application is an app like a website, but instead works on a web browser. Web applications run on a web server instead of a personal computer.</p>
<h2>Who uses Web Apps ?</h2>
<p>Websites have been developing exponentially for recent decades on account of the enhanced development of the Internet. Notably, companies are boosting their in-office apps for workers to perform more flexible jobs. Regardless of location, these programs <strong>enable workers to function anywhere.</strong></p>
<p>Like other apps, web applications have some<strong> positive and negative features</strong>. Before app development, it is important to be aware of the positive and negative aspects of apps.</p>
<p>I will highlight 5 Benefits of and Disadvantages of Using a Web Application in the below. It will be useful to you to learn about the pros and cons of using web applications.</p>
<h2>Advantages of Web Application</h2>
<h3>1. Cost</h3>
<p>Writing just a small number of lines of code can be sufficient to create an application for a web application. As a result, it can be released for only a single platform rather than several versions of the app.</p>
<p>There is another in the form of a no cost in testing the app in each and every operating system. I have been told this is a <strong>tremendous alternative for companies</strong>.</p>
<h3>2. Updates</h3>
<p>Unlike other types of software, apps are not frequently updated. When you need a web app that is connected to the website directly, the developers ensure that the application is updated with the most recent code.</p>
<h3>3. Customization</h3>
<p>Making adjustments is recommended for the convenient customization of web apps. As a result, the work necessary to run a company can be simplified.</p>
<p>And, <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/26002/web-based-application">web-based programs</a> are also frequently thought to be safe since it's less probable they will be hacked.</p>
<h3>4. Download Requirement</h3>
<p>An application can be run with no difficulty via a web browser rather than by downloading it to the app store or the play store. This saves the need for app store download.</p>
<h3>5. Platform Support</h3>
<p>Online apps automatically work on any type of screen, regardless of the size. They support cross-platform operating systems, such as Windows, iOS, macOS, and Android, but they also must comply with a browser's technical requirements.</p>

<br />
<h2>Disadvantages of Web Application</h2>
<h3>1. Performance</h3>
<p>A website is directly linked to an internet browser. Therefore, the size for a site tends to grow. As a consequence, the impact of this can be seen in the go on a web application. A large app operates significantly <strong>more slowly than a native desktop app.</strong></p>
<h3>2. Security</h3>
<p>Applications without copy control are unable to remedy data-security issues, making <a href="https://www.snaplogic.com/glossary/ssl-authentication">SSL authorization</a> incapable of solving this problem.</p>
<h3>3. Availability</h3>
<p>It's not easy to publicize the usage of third-party plugins on your website. It is, therefore, tough for individuals to find these company suppliers.</p>
<h3>4. Web Issues</h3>
<p>Only your progress on the website hinges on its performance, so if your Internet site goes down, your application will go with it. This is why your application can't perform at its level without having <strong>adequate analytics.</strong></p>
<h3>5. Internet Dependence</h3>
<p>The program you're running must have an Internet connection. Without one, you won't be able to start browsing or collaborating.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <a href="https://awddigital.com.au/">web design</a> is a creative field. It is a combination of visual and technology skills. These two aspects are combined to create web pages. Web designers create new web pages that look good and work smoothly on computers, tablets and smartphones. They also work with other specialists to make sure that messages on websites, emails and banners are <strong>easy to understand.</strong></p>
