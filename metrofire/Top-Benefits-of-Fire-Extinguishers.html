										<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fire extinguishers are those little objects often found in the kitchen, the garage, the office, etc. They are one of the most frequently used objects in our culture. But many people are unaware of the beneficial aspects of fire extinguishers, which is why they're so easily forgotten, or are simply ignored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the event of a fire, the primary objective of the fire department is to extinguish the flames in the shortest amount of time. This means that each fire extinguisher should be ready to go, in an accessible location, and ready to be used immediately. This is the job of the fire extinguisher technician, or Technician, who is responsible for </span><a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=1&amp;contentid=506"><span style="font-weight: 400;">checking the extinguishers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> every day and making sure they are in working order, as well as ensuring that they are placed in locations where they are easily accessible to all.</span></p>
<h2>Keeping Fires Under Control</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you think of a fire extinguisher, you probably envision a big green canister, but in reality, most extinguishers are small, hand-held devices that contain dry chemical and foam agents. That said, there are some</span> <strong>extinguishers that are especially suited to fighting fire</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The most common, and perhaps the most important, is the dry chemical extinguisher. These extinguishers contain a primary agent, which in the case of the dry chemical, is the chemical sodium bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate is a powdery white substance that, when mixed with water, forms a solution that is especially effective in putting out fires of all kinds.</span></p>

<h2>They&rsquo;re better for the environment</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people are unaware of the danger of having a fire in your home, and thus don't use a fire extinguisher. A fire extinguisher has many uses, providing a </span><strong>safe and effective way to put out a small fire</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The </span><a href="https://www.fcfnational.com.au/blog/the-importance-of-fire-extinguisher-training"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best fire extinguishers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have a gauge indicating the amount of water they can hold, as well as a gauge indicating the amount of fuel needed to put out the fire. They also have a pressure gauge which indicates the pressure of the extinguisher. This saves fire victims the hassle of having to empty and refill the extinguisher.</span></p>
<h2>Save people in 80% of fire accidents</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many incidents throughout the world where people are killed due to fire. To protect your loved ones and your property, it is important to have a fire extinguisher in the home, office, or in the garage. A fire extinguisher can be used to put out a fire, before it gets too big, or even to prevent one from breaking out in the first place. When a fire occurs, it is important to have the </span><strong>right fire extinguisher nearby</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you have the right tools, you can help save people in 80% of all fire accidents. The wrong fire extinguisher could kill everyone. In more than 80% of all fire accidents, people die because they do not have the right fire extinguisher with them.</span></p>
<h2>Save Property and Lives</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know that smoke detectors are great for saving lives, but the </span><a href="https://www.usfa.fema.gov/prevention/outreach/extinguishers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best way to save property</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is with a fire extinguisher. These handy tools can be mounted in your home or office, or stored in your car, so you are </span><strong>prepared for any fire emergency</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fire extinguisher is an essential tool that can help save property and lives in the event of a fire. If you are in a new home, you may not have a fire extinguisher, or you may not have one in a location where it could be easily reached. If you live in an apartment, you may not have one in the unit where the fire occurred, or you may not have a fire extinguisher in the unit where you live. Fire extinguishers should be placed in locations where they are </span><a href="http://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/Staying-safe/Safety-equipment/Fire-extinguishers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">easy to reach</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and should be available in multiple locations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping a fire extinguisher is useless if your employees do not know how to operate them. Luckily, you can ask your local fire department to conduct </span><a href="https://www.metrofire.com.au/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fire safety training</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seminars for this purpose. The fire training gives you the necessary knowledge and readiness to deal with the situation.</span></p>
