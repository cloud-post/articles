										<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of our commitment to providing our employees with the skills to respond to the immediate impact of an emergency, we've planned for an aggressive Emergency Response Training (ERT) program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the fact that occupational </span><a href="https://www.osha.gov/data/commonstats"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fatalities and injuries in the workplace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be </span><strong>extremely costly and devastating</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for employers and employees alike, the widespread lack of awareness about the importance of workplace safety remains a problem. Often, employees will not report unsafe working conditions to their employers because of the fear of retaliation. Another reason for this is the belief that such issues don't happen in their industry or workplace.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monitoring for response readiness</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know that when there's an </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">emergency in our community</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, our </span><a href="https://www.ready.gov/business/implementation/emergency"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first response is crucial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Whether the situation involves a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, or a mass shooting, the first responders who are closest to the incident are often the people who are most able to save lives. Since emergency response is the first thing that many people think about when they think about emergency response training, there are </span><strong>several aspects</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of that training that are essential for all of us to know.</span></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="images/Emergency Response Training.jpg" alt="Emergency Response" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rescue procedures and protocols</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examining the many different types of Emergency Response training is a little like a check-list. You start with a basic set of tools, step-by-step instructions on when to use them, and an outline of what to do when you need to deploy them. Once you've put in the initial work, the only real challenge is getting the right training materials to use with your employees, whether in a classroom or in a </span><strong>virtual class</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improve responder confidence</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Responder confidence is when they are in control of their own safety in an emergency.&nbsp; It is critical to be able to work in </span><strong>close proximity</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to high-risk individuals/groups with the intention of neutralizing the threat. The majority of the time responders have no idea what type of training they need to be truly effective in this role.This is the most critical skill they will need to learn. It is also incredibly difficult to teach.</span></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="images/Emergency Response.jpg" alt="Emergency Response Training" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to deal with site-specific hazards?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of hazards in the workplace that fall under the category of "</span><strong>site-specific</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">," which means they require a different response depending on the situation. Many employers have their own programs in place related to these hazards, but in order for these programs to be effective, they need to be tailored to employees in a way that is easily understood and followed, and there is a critical need to do so when it comes to site-specific hazards.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilize safety resources</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way for your organization to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">prevent and respond to incidents </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">like bombings is to be well prepared and to train and prepare the right people. It's also important that your employees understand their roles during an emergency, and what to do when faced with a crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The employer should provide the employee with all of the safety resources they need to perform his or her job safely, For example, the employer should ensure the employee has the </span><a href="https://www.mpofcinci.com/blog/what-is-hazard-communication/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appropriate hazard communication</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> training, that the employee knows where the company&rsquo;s safety policies are located, that the employee has access to a safety committee, the employee has access to the company&rsquo;s safety hotline, that the employee knows where fire extinguishers are located, that the employee knows where exits are located.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.metrofire.com.au/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergency response</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> training gives employees a chance to practice and refine skills they need to handle an emergency situation. With </span><strong>hands-on training and group exercises</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they will know what to do, rather than wondering what to do in an emergency. Employees will gain confidence in their abilities and be better prepared to handle an emergency situation.</span></p>
