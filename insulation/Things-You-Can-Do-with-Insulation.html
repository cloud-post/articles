          Things You Can Do with Insulation

      </h1>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chances are you may have seen insulation in your home at some point,</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> either on the walls or on ceilings. As an insulator, it does its job well, but the process of making it is not that straightforward. The insulation is made of various materials including fibers, paper, and plastic. Each of these materials is used in different ways to achieve specific goals, and each material has different properties. To make this clearer, let's take a look at the ways insulation is applied in different types of homes.</span></p>
<h2>New exterior walls</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many people are aware that insulation can </span><strong>improve the efficiency</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of their homes, they don't realize it can also improve the look of their walls. Well, not their walls, per say, but their exterior walls. And by "exterior", we mean the exterior walls of the house, including the basement, first floor, second floor, and attic. And by "improve", we mean insulate the walls so they are warmer inside than outside.</span></p>
<h2>Air leakage points</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the temperature rises:</span></em></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glass</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metal</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plastic</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">...all susceptible to heat loss. While you can always turn up the heat, it's not the most efficient method of heat control. By utilizing air leakage points in your home, you can effectively trap heat inside your home, </span><a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/renovate/heating/a1014/reduce-heat-loss-home/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reducing the amount of heat lost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through your walls, floors, and ceilings.</span></p>
<h2>Stop draft and mice</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drafts and mice can both be pesky pests, but what can you do about them? Insulation is a great way to stop drafts from making it into your home as well as keep mice out. Insulation is a term that refers to any material used to prevent cold from entering buildings, rooms, and homes. It includes interior and exterior building materials used for thermal insulation, noise isolation, and acoustical insulation.</span></p>
<h2>Renovated basements</h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people consider their home an investment</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which makes your house a great place to spend money. But, if your house is not well insulated, you are really losing money. There are several ways to spend less energy by insulating your attic, walls, and doors.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>Fire protection</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we all know, insulation is a simple, yet essential performing material that helps keep our homes warm and safe. It keeps heat from escaping and helps keep us </span><strong>safe from electrical fire</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Many people don't comprehend the magnitude of keeping insulation in place, and how it can help protect lives and property. Plus, it&rsquo;s used in all sorts of construction and building applications, and its uses extend far beyond home and building construction.</span></p>
<h2>Sound proofing</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insulation is the backbone of any </span><a href="https://www.hometips.com/buying-guides/soundproofing-insulation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sound proofing project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Unfortunately, insulation is not always easily categorized. It can be classified as vapor retarder, vapor barrier, or soundproofing material. It is the function of the insulation that determines the outcome of a sound proofing project and if you are living in an apartment or have neighbors who have parties, there are even sounds you can't hear at all.</span></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.bobvila.com/articles/types-of-insulation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">best thing about insulation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is that you can </span><strong>always get creative</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
