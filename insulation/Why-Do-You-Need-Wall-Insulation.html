                        <p><strong>Insulation is a great way to improve your home's energy efficiency,</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but it can also raise your home's resale value. If you're looking to add insulation to your home, there are several ways to go about it. The three most common types of insulation are blown in, blown in with spray foam, and spray foam. The advantages of the first two are that they can be installed quickly, while the disadvantages are that they can wear out over time, and they require a professional to install.</span></p><br>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insulation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the most important factors to consider when deciding what type of insulation to use in your home. While the </span><a href="https://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/insulation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cost of insulating your home</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is often overlooked, the benefits of better insulation are huge.</span></p><br>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efficient Heating and Cooling</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most important factors in regards to the longevity of your home is its energy efficiency. In fact an estimated 80% of a home's energy bill is spent on heating and cooling, and even a small reduction in these costs could significantly increase the lifespan of your home. You can save up to 50% of your heating and cooling costs by installing a </span><a href="https://www.archiexpo.com/architecture-design-manufacturer/high-performance-insulation-40083.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high performance insulation product</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like this one.</span></p><br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most important things to consider when you're looking to insulate your new home is how much energy it will use to heat or cool. This is because energy efficiency is a </span><strong>key component</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to your house's overall energy performance, so it's important to save on energy costs while still keeping your home comfortable.</span></p>

<div class="grid_12"><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better Acoustics</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.soundproofingstore.co.uk/soundproofing-insulation#:~:text=Acoustic%20insulation%2C%20(or%20soundproofing),so%20easily%20through%20a%20structure.&amp;text=The%20other%20principle%20in%20effective,hits%20a%20wall%20or%20floor."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acoustic insulation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helps control sound transmission between rooms. If a room is poorly insulated, it will be a noisy, unpleasant place, with echoes and other unwanted sounds bouncing around. This can also cause health problems, from hearing loss to depression. Acoustic insulation is an effective way of treating rooms that suffer from poor insulation.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reduction of Heat Loss</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insulation is a key component to any energy efficiency project. The wall or ceiling is the largest surface in the house and the most likely to get cold spots. It is therefore critical to insulate the wall first, as it will require the least amount of insulation and will be the most expensive to insulate.</span></p><br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order for a home to be comfortable, it needs to be insulated. Proper insulation helps to lower energy bills and</span><strong> reduce heat loss</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the outdoors, while cold drafts and hot air leaks can cause weather damage and increase cooling costs. Regardless of the type of home, the goal is to find the right amount of insulation for the size of the house and the climate you live in.</span></p><br></div>
