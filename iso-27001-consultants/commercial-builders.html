    			<p><a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/business-email-compromise-(bec)">Business email compromise </a>does not use links, malware, or attachments. These emails closely resemble normal emails and are therefore difficult, but not impossible, to detect.</p>
<p>In closing, Phishing emails are the least reliable form of email. Your spam filter is your most dependable tool for stopping phishing. While spam filters are far from perfect, they are far more reliable than heuristics and user education. Tens of thousands of companies, including Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, and Yahoo, filter billions of spam emails a year, yet no sign of success. Phishing is a threat to your PC and your data, and it's up to you to stop it.Phishing attacks are computer security scams that trick you into thinking you are interacting with a legitimate company, usually a bank or some other financial institution. Once you click the button, you're often asked to enter sensitive information, like personal identification numbers, or you're redirected to a fake website to trick you into giving up your account information. Hackers are then able to gain access to your account without your knowledge.</p>
<p>Phishing emails are not new. Despite widespread coverage in the print and online press, a wide variety of anti phishing solutions, and significant corporate warning systems, why are a massive 93% of all data breaches due to phishing? Of those breaches, <em>the average annual cost to a medium-sized employer is $1.6 million</em>. Don't view this issue lightly.</p>

<h2><strong>Different Types of Phishing</strong></h2>
<p>Phishing comes in various types, with different strategies employed by scammers. Below is a brief description of each <a href="https://securityscorecard.com/blog/types-of-phishing-attacks-and-how-to-identify-them">phishing type</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Phishing:</strong> This broad term for email-based exploits involves hackers tricking targets into clicking a link or opening a malicious attachment to gain access to <em>highly sensitive data, passwords, or bank account and credit card details.</em></p>
<p><strong>Spear Phishing: </strong>These are emails sent only to a select few, often customized to deceive the recipient into opening them with their personal information. It arises through the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>Clone Phishing: </strong>This is a type of attempted attack whereby the legitimate email address and email address are cloned, after which another message is sent from that lookalike address with structurally different contents or attached malicious files.</p>
<p><strong>Whaling Phishing, BEC and Pretexting: </strong>Cybercriminals attempt to trick high-ranking executives, including <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/careers/designations/ceo-vs-cfo/">CFOs and CEOs</a>, into providing a wire transfer to a fraudulent account or using an employee to direct a wire transfer to help with fraud.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Are Phishing Attacks Still So Successful?</strong></h2>
<p>In spite of how common anti-spam strategies and secure email gateways can kill off a substantial number of phishing messages, there will always be a number that make it in the inbox. This raises a company's vulnerability to attack. According to an email security test performed by the United Kingdom-based SE Labs, Microsoft Office 365's email security rating was only 8 out of 100. Microsoft Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection's security rating was not significantly higher, with an accuracy of 35.</p>
<p>By exploiting filters and security experts, unscrupulous individuals are able to bypass online security mechanisms to add unsuspecting citizens to their zombie armies.</p>
<h2><strong>Highly Targeted</strong></h2>
<p>Because of the low attacks these technologies are facing, their signature-based <a href="https://expertinsights.com/insights/top-10-phishing-protection-solutions/">anti-phishing solutions </a>are only useful against spear phishing and BEC emails.</p>
<h2><strong>Look Legitimate</strong></h2>
<p>Scam scammers have figured out a way to get countless people to give their money and trust them by email. The days when scam emails were easily spotted because their <strong>poor grammar and spelling </strong>were on their last legs and the addresses to which they should not have been sent were really easy to track down are long gone.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="phishing-emails-22.jpg" alt="phishing" /></p>
<h2><strong>Play on Human Weaknesses</strong></h2>
<p>Scammers know how to exploit the weaknesses in human psychology that make you care about how others see you, fear of punishment, and thirst for approval. Cleverly playing on these vulnerabilities, <strong>cybercriminals try to use one's immediate emotions</strong> to make one act before thinking.</p>
<h2><strong>Reference Current News and Events</strong></h2>
<p>Articles or people of interest to people, like the <em>Olympics, the Super Bowl, political figures, tax season, the Oscars, or Brexit,</em> can be viewed as bellwethers for introducing an idea or feigning legitimacy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Some phishing emails try to trick you into clicking on the malicious link. However, some phishing emails do not ask you to click any link. Instead, the phishing email asks you for your password or asks you to type some personal information. You should never click on links in an email that asks for your personal information. Also, you should not respond to an email asking for your personal information. Instead, you should delete the email.</p>
