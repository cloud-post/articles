                              <h1>5 Vital Roles of 3PL Logistics in the Supply Chain
</h1>
<br>
<p>The term 3PL has been around for a long time. The acronym is generally used in the supply chain industry to refer to companies that provide third-party logistics (3PL) services. The 3PL provider is responsible for moving the goods from the supplier to the point of consumption. Because the 3PL provider is outside the confines of the supply chain, they often are considered the first and last link in the supply chain.</p>
<h2>What is a 3PL Logistics Provider?</h2>
<p>A third-party logistics (3PL) business supplies logistics services to businesses operated by a third party. As a business leader, the 3PL company should not be simply a mere go-between between you and your chosen 3PL, but also a trusted partner for you. Third-party logistics are<strong> cost-effective</strong> in the long run and can improve your company's viability with the many <a href="https://www.cleo.com/blog/knowledge-base-3pl-third-party-logistics">benefits favourable relationships</a> can bring.3PL logistics offers warehousing services, distribution of raw materials and finished products, a unification between freight and customs, the excellent management of cargo, and great order fulfilment.</p>
