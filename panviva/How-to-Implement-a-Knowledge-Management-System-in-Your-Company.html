										<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">A knowledge management system (KMS) is an integrated system that helps organizations manage and utilize their knowledge</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is a software-based solution that helps an organization identify and capture knowledge, which is then used to provide value to the organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are all professionals to some extent, but let&rsquo;s face it, most of us are not system administrators or developers. We are not always able to develop our ideas, to think of solutions to the problems we face, or even to </span><strong>make the right decisions</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Organizations are often reluctant to invest in IT infrastructure, yet they expect the same productivity from the people who use it. This is where a knowledge </span><a href="https://www.panviva.com/products/knowledge-management-system"><span style="font-weight: 400;">management system from Panviva</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comes in to save the day.</span></p>

<h2>Establish goals</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having goals is essential to realizing your full potential. By setting goals to achieve, you decide what you would like to do with your time, and to accomplish your goals you need to prioritize what is important to you. By setting goals you are choosing how to spend your time. Knowing what you want to accomplish and why you want to accomplish it will help you in your decision making.</span></p>
<h2>Develop a change management strategy</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most nonprofits, </span><a href="https://www.kmworld.com/About/What_is_Knowledge_Management"><span style="font-weight: 400;">knowledge management is all about</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> generating, storing, retrieving, analysing, exchanging, sharing, and analysing the knowledge that is owned by the organization. However, </span><strong>many people fail to understand</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that knowledge, or the information they are trying to manage, is not confined to the knowledge of the organization alone.</span></p>
<h2>Involve Leadership</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://broadvision.com/blog/top-5-reasons-knowledge-management-necessary/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">purpose of knowledge management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to get people involved in information and get more employees to get involved. Many people feel that the current job market is too competitive and that they need to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">develop new skills or improve their current skills</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get ahead. But there is a better way to get ahead and also get your company more involved. One way to do this is to involve your employees in your company and get them involved in the decision making and sharing of knowledge and ideas.</span></p>

<h2>Build an implementation roadmap</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.productplan.com/learn/creating-a-roadmap/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">idea of a roadmap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (or route map) is an old and </span><strong>well-known concept</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It describes how to get from one place to another using a network of roads, and how to move from one level of a hierarchy to another. The idea of a roadmap is frequently used in business and software projects. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">It describes how to implement a project</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (or deliverables).</span></p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizational knowledge management is a major enterprise challenge, which is handled in silos, having created barriers between people, departments, and organizations. While the process of knowledge management is </span><strong>not yet complete</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there is a need to integrate it with other processes, such as data management.</span></p>
