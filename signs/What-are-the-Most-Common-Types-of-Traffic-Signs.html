                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traffic signs are pretty common these days, but they don't seem to be used as much as they should be. They are usually used by the police for the purpose of telling you what to do and putting you in danger when you are doing something wrong. </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many types of traffic signs, but the three most common are:</span></em></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">* Stop Signs</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">* Yield Signs</span></p>
<p>* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian_crossing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crosswalk Signs</span></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regulatory Signs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traffic signs are important to us all. Whether driving down the road or walking along the pavement, we all rely on these signs for important information and reminders, such as speed limits, the meaning of stop signs, or the </span><strong>instructions to cross the road</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The rules of the road are really quite simple: when a sign tells you to stop, you stop. However, many drivers can't seem to heed these rules. For example, many drivers ignore stop signs and red lights, speeding down the road and putting themselves and others in danger.</span></p>

<div class="grid_12"><h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warning Signs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most basic of all </span><a href="https://www.artcraft.com.au/traffic-signage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">traffic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> signs are the stop signs. But, they come in many different colors and shapes. As you can see, there are many different types of stop signs. Some stop signs are red while others are yellow. Some have arrows pointing in different directions. The stop sign that you see at a road intersection is a stop sign because one driver can stop, while another driver can continue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traffic signs play an important role in our lives, and as a result they are a source of safety and guidance. While their purpose is clear, there are three </span><strong>types of traffic signs</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The first type, which encompasses the majority of traffic signs, warns about hazards and dangerous situations. The second type helps to indicate how to behave on the road, and the third type informs us about speed limits and other traffic regulations.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guide Signs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For all of you who are too busy to look at your speedometer or too lazy to look down at the odometer, there's a new option: a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_camera"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traffic Camera</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These cameras are found in some different places around the city and they have been put in place to help the police catch speeders. Unlike the</span><strong> standard traffic cameras</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, these ones are designed to catch people who aren't doing 80 miles per hour on the highway. These signs are located on the side of the highway, usually in the center, or near the sign that tells you when you are approaching the speed limit.</span></p><br>

                        <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information Signs</span></h2>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traffic signs are often overlooked as a source of information, but they play an important role in helping:</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">* Drivers</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">* Bicyclists</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">* Pedestrians</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">...navigate our roads. These signs communicate information about road rules, speed limits, special warnings and other traffic controls.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_sign"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information signs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicate the rules of the road and are used to inform drivers of the rules and regulations that need to be followed. In general, the signs are used when a driver must obey the law.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should always be careful when driving, especially if you're a pedestrian. The best way to avoid a traffic accident is to exercise </span><strong>good judgement</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, especially when it comes to pedestrians. Always look for the path of least resistance and be careful when changing lanes. It's also important to remain vigilant and stay focused on the road when you're driving.</span></p><br>
